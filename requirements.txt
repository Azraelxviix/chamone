# --- CHANGELOG & DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS ---
#
# The primary advantage of pinning all dependencies (e.g., numpy==2.3.2) is
# Stability and Reproducibility. When left unpinned, a library might release
# an update with a bug or breaking change, causing future deployments to fail
# unexpectedly. Pinning ensures that every build uses the exact same, tested
# [cite_start]versions of all packages. [cite: 931, 933]
#
# Transitive Dependencies: Major libraries rely on others. For example,
# 'google-cloud-aiplatform' relies on 'pydantic'. If these are not pinned,
# they also pose a stability risk. For a production pipeline, it is best
# [cite_start]practice to pin critical transitive dependencies as well. [cite: 934, 935]
#
# --- DEPRECATED & REMOVED MODULES ---
#
# v17.0.5: Removed google-genai as all calls now use the google-cloud-aiplatform SDK.
# # 💀 google-genai (last known: 1.32.0)
#
# v17.0.4: Removed local embedding packages to migrate to Vertex AI managed embeddings.
# # 💀 sentence-transformers (last known: 5.1.0)
# # 💀 transformers (last known: 4.52.4)
# # 💀 huggingface-hub (last known: 0.31.4)
# # 💀 torch (last known: 2.8.0+cpu)
#
# v17.0.3: Added psycopg_pool for database connection management.
